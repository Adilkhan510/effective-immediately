Welcome! Thanks for visiting. This is an open-source project, the format and medium of which are inspired by jlevy's Equity Guide to Compensation (thank you! We've been sharing that with our candidates for a while).

We welcome contributions of all sizes, but if you submit a pull request or file issues, please keep it small and manageable.

The easiest way to submit a change right now is to contact our team at effectiveimmediately3@gmail.com.
