# effective-immediately
A central hub for employers, employees, or people who've been recently laid off. We hope each of you can find helpful resources about handling or recovering from layoffs during a pandemic.

### Why does this exist?
We got laid off in early March 2020, just as America's (and to our eye, the tech industry's) wave of layoffs was building. Our company asked us to stay another month to be an information conduit and to help our former colleagues-- also laid-off-- get connected to job opportunities.

During that month, many more people were laid off and the spreadsheets, LinkedIn and Twitter postings, articles, forms, lists, and more kept piling up. The signal to noise ratio was becoming unmanageable, data about who was hiring was becoming stale day by day.

We don't know yet if that wave has crested, but we're still seeing layoff news every week. By early April, we decided the work we'd done to help our colleagues might be useful to other people after we finished. We also kept finding resources in corners we didn't know about and wondered if there couldn't be a more community-supported, centralized way to share information.

And thus, Effective Immediately was born.

### Who are we?
Your core maintainers here are [Eben Dower](https://linkedin.com/in/eben-dower), [Kevin Landucci](https://linkedin.com/in/kevinlanducci), and [Krista Lane](https://linkedin.com/in/krista-lane), all former Senior Talent Managers at Triplebyte.

[Jordan Helsloot](https://linkedin.com/in/jordanhelsloot) is a valued contributor to Effective Immediately and former Head of Talent Management at Triplebyte.

[Trent Krupp](https://linkedin.com/in/trentkrupp), Triplebyte's current VP of Operations, lent fundamental support and encouragement to enable this project to exist beyond Triplebyte.

Although our origins began with Triplebyte, Effective Immediately has no remaining affiliation (in any legally binding manner, at least) to it. We will not comment specifically about Triplebyte or its layoffs.

Lastly, a brief disclaimer: the three of us are not perfect. We chose a community, open-sourced model for this project because we know we're better together. But 2/3 of us are new to Github, and we know our perspective can be siloed when we came from the same company in the same location.

### How to use this
We are heavily inspired by how [jlevy](https://github.com/jlevy) organized his open source [Guide to Equity Compensation](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation) (we'd been sharing this with candidates for a while-- thank you!) and so our current approach is for this readme to be comprehensive, well-organized, searchable and community-supported.

### How to contribute

Let's get to it.

## Getting oneself sorted / taking care
This section contains resources people who've been laid off may find useful right off the bat, before or while figuring out next steps.

Getting laid off under any circumstance is no walk in the park, but during a pandemic is really hard. Be kind to yourself and give yourself a moment (or a few, whatever you need) to breathe and feel however you feel about it.

#### Immediately after notification
- If HR doesn't answered these 7 questions for you, find out. [HBR: 7 questions to raise after you're laid off](https://hbr.org/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-off). Although worth reading for the context, since it's paywalled, the basic questions are:
-* When do I receive my last paycheck? Will I receive severance pay? How long will I have to exercise my stock options? Does the company offer healthcare coverage after my last day, and if so for how long? Will you provide a reference for me? How can I get copies of my performance reviews, and by when? What will happen to my 401(k)?
-* We'd add, "Will I be able to keep my computer/related equipment?" If not, and you don't have a personal machine, ask if it's possible to keep on loan until you find your next job. This is particularly important considering public access to computer facilities (like the library) is restricted right now, and many of your interviews will be conducted remotely using a computer that can connect to videoconferencing software.

#### Self-care and resilience
- Maintaining one's health is critical, mentally and physically. Therapy can really help. If you're on a tight budget, here are five affordable ideas courtesy of [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/therapy-for-every-budget). [Vox](https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/7/21207281/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-find-a-therapist) also has ideas specific to finding a therapist (including insurance-friendly telehealth options) during COVID-19 shelter-in-place.
- Here's a list on Lavandaire of [15 quarantine-friendly ideas](https://www.lavendaire.com/staycation/) for self-care and relaxation.
- If relaxing isn't your speed right now, we made a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0VLUWd7h897BU1BBxSrbHh?si=Y9MlHqpsQEq475-dQU8YBQ) for being laid off in a pandemic that reads a bit like a breakup list. It's collaborative; feel free to add things that help(ed) you!
- [Dealing with worry after a coronavirus layoff](https://qz.com/work/1830606/how-to-deal-with-worry-after-a-coronavirus-layoff/) - from Quartz
- For many, spring 2020 is one of the most challenging times of our lives, even without a layoff involved. Adapting and building resilience will be key to moving forward, both to survive and (eventually) thrive. Here's the [APA's guide to building resilience](https://www.apa.org/topics/resilience).

#### Broaden your community
You aren't alone. Find others sharing what's helped them, and share what's helped you that might help others.
- [Silver Lining](https://www.getsilverlining.com/) is a site for candidates and companies. It includes a talent dashboard for candidates to get discovered, job boards to browse, their own [collection of resources](https://www.getsilverlining.com/resources), and a growing Slack community offering support by career coaches and peers. Companies can browse candidates if they're hiring, or register their layoff to quickly connect their affected employees to support.
- Does your company (or previous companies you've worked at) have an alumni network you can connect with for support or job opportunities (or both)? Maybe other communities, like a church, club or university?

#### Unemployment benefits
- Your specific unemployment benefits will vary depending on your state, situation, etc. But you can start with [edd.ca.gov](https://edd.ca.gov) if you're in California, and the federal government also has info at [usa.gov/unemployment](https://www.usa.gov/unemployment).
- There are new benefits specifically during the state of emergency caused by COVID-19, some of which apply to everyone affected, and some of which apply only to those who lost jobs directly because of COVID-19.

#### All-in-one guides that cover some or all of the above (and below)
- Kevin Landucci made a [30-day plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bhuq69I1l8AjLcCcm_3kZofdtAT3C-d7paBKlC2C3lg/edit).
- Jordan Helsloot assembled [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sssZI5H7LSH1V0eiTU7b2ERFi4GLDSS0Jw-PkXmVmtc/edit?usp=sharing) for our former Triplebyte colleagues from resources collected and shared by all of us over March/April.
- Helen Wang assembled [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nZ9s-0nQke6-lO6iaku-TZLVaWjxsM39z4P1smlDeQs/edit#heading=h.5j2gplfgz7dh) for their former Yelp colleagues, but it's broadly applicable. Covers basic details re: filing for unemployment, stimulus info at a glance, and maintaining some income while you job-search, etc.

## Applying to jobs

#### Getting organized
We cannot recommend highly enough staying organized in this process. Don't trust yourself to remember everywhere you've applied in your head while so much is going on. Track who you're talking to, from where, about which role, anticipated next steps, and how you feel about that opportunity.
- Here's a basic [sample job search tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qTpAQoZr8vu_yJZ2Du9f3sYgM0kldscqXdyHGfGQ0SU/edit#gid=0) you can adapt for yourself, courtesy of Jordan Helsloot.
- [Huntr.co](https://huntr.co/) website-ifies this concept if you like pretty things.
- Some people write daily schedules to keep themselves on track for their job search. If that works for you, awesome!
- Others find goal-setting within a wider time frame to be more effective for them. An example: rather than spending 9-11am updating resume, 2-3pm preparing applications/requesting intros, etc, you might find it easier to set achievable goals you control, such as, "by the end of day Wednesday, I will have applied to 15 jobs." Break that down into manageable tasks (research/bookmark jobs, update resume, write cover letter, update tracker, etc.) that build up to the overall goal for that time period. Find what works for you.
