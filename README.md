# effective-immediately
A central hub for employers, employees, or people who've been recently laid off. We hope each of you can find helpful resources about handling or recovering from layoffs during a pandemic.

## Why does this exist?
We got laid off in early March 2020, just as America's (and to our eye, the tech industry's) wave of layoffs was building. Our company asked us to stay another month to be an information conduit and to help our former colleagues-- also laid-off-- get connected to job opportunities.

During that month, many more people were laid off and the spreadsheets, LinkedIn and Twitter postings, articles, forms, lists, and more kept piling up. The signal to noise ratio was becoming unmanageable, data about who was hiring was becoming stale day by day.

We don't know yet if that wave has crested, but we're still seeing layoff news every week. By early April, we decided the work we'd done to help our colleagues might be useful to other people after we finished. We also kept finding resources in corners we didn't know about and wondered if there couldn't be a more community-supported, centralized way to share information.

And thus, Effective Immediately was born.

## Who are we?
Your core maintainers here are [Eben Dower](https://linkedin.com/in/eben-dower), [Kevin Landucci](https://linkedin.com/in/kevinlanducci), and [Krista Lane](https://linkedin.com/in/krista-lane), all former Senior Talent Managers at Triplebyte.

[Jordan Helsloot](https://linkedin.com/in/jordanhelsloot) is a valued contributor to Effective Immediately and former Head of Talent Management at Triplebyte.

[Trent Krupp](https://linkedin.com/in/trentkrupp), Triplebyte's current VP of Operations, lent fundamental support and encouragement to enable this project to exist beyond Triplebyte.

Although our origins began with Triplebyte, Effective Immediately has no remaining affiliation (in any legally binding manner, at least) to it. We will not comment specifically about Triplebyte or its layoffs.

Lastly, a brief disclaimer: the three of us are not perfect. We chose a community, open-sourced model for this project because we know we're better together. But 2/3 of us are new to Github, and we know our perspective can be siloed when we came from the same company in the same location.

## How to use this
We are heavily inspired by how [jlevy](https://github.com/jlevy) organized his open source [Guide to Equity Compensation](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation) (we'd been sharing this with candidates for a while-- thank you!) and so our current approach is for this readme to be comprehensive, well-organized, searchable and community-supported.
